Issue: desire for more powerful air dash
Improvement: can charge air dash to make it more powerful; alternating team hits make ball more responsive to dash

Issue: desire for more feedback
Improvement: air dash trail; charging indicated by player shake and pupil expansion; ball trail

Improvement: ball spawns between the players, and either can serve -- fosters team communication

Issue: lack of precision in jumping
Improvement: variable jump height

Issue: abrupt game over screen with no info regarding who won -- requires keyboard for restart
Improvement: team-colored fireworks on game win; delayed game over screen with improved information that works with controllers

Issue: needs more team collaboration
Improvement: alternate team hits to charge ball
